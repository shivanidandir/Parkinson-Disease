# Parkinson-Disease
Python

This project is aimed to detect PArkinson Disease with the help of XGBoost.

Parkinson's disease is a progressive nervous system disorder that affects movement. Symptoms start gradually, sometimes starting with a barely noticeable tremor in just one hand. Tremors are common, but the disorder also commonly causes stiffness or slowing of movement.It has 5 stages to it and affects more than 1 million individuals every year in India. This is chronic and has no cure yet.

[XGBoost](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is an optimized distributed gradient boosting library designed to be highly efficient, flexible and portable. It implements machine learning algorithms under the Gradient Boosting framework. XGBoost provides a parallel tree boosting (also known as GBDT, GBM) that solve many data science problems in a fast and accurate way.

This machine learning project, is to detect the presence of Parkinsonâ€™s Disease in individuals using various factors. By using an XGBClassifier and making use of the sklearn library to prepare the dataset. It gave an accuracy of 94.87%, with only 10 line of code.
